# 8-Bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) Implementation

## Overview

This project implements an 8-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) using Verilog, along with a testbench to verify its functionality. The ALU performs common arithmetic (addition, subtraction) and logic (AND, OR, XOR, NAND, NOR, XNOR) operations on two 8-bit input buses based on selection inputs.

## Prerequisites

- Verilog compiler (e.g., Icarus Verilog)
- Simulation tool (e.g., GTKWave)
- Python (for input handling)

## Running the Simulation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/not-adarsh/ArithematicLogicalUnit.git
   ```

2. Incase you are using Icarus verilog
    - Move this folder to `C:/iverilog/bin` folder on ***Windows***.
    - Move this folder to `usr/iverilog/bin` folder on ***Linux***.

3. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd ArithematicLogicalUnit
   ```

4. Run the Python script to compile and simulate the Verilog code:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
